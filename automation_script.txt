INSTALL AND UPGRADE OPTIONS
    The general form of an rpm install command is

    rpm {-i|--install} [install-options] PACKAGE_FILE ...

    This installs a new package.

    The general form of an rpm upgrade command is

    rpm {-U|--upgrade} [install-options] PACKAGE_FILE ...

    This install the package or upgrades the package currently installed  to  a  newer
    version.   This  is the same as install, except all other version(s) of
    the package are removed after the new package is installed.
